<h1>AI/ML Tasks: Let's Build Together</h1>
<p>It's time to dive into some hands-on learning! We’ve combined basic and intermediate tasks into a single, impactful challenge. Follow the steps and challenge yourself!</p>

<h2>Step 1:</h2>
<p>Start by learning Git/GitHub and version control from the link below:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.simplilearn.com/learn-git-basics-skillup" target="_blank">Git Session</a></p>

<h2>Step 2: Your Task - Taxi Fare Prediction Challenge</h2>

<h3>Model Building & Evaluation:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Train a <strong>regression model</strong> (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, etc.) to predict taxi fares. Feel free to experiment with different models and select the one that works best for your dataset.</li>
    <li>After training, evaluate your model’s performance using relevant evaluation metrics such as <strong>Mean Squared Error (MSE)</strong>, <strong>Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)</strong>, or <strong>R² Score</strong>. Aim for accuracy between <strong>97-100%</strong>.</li>
    <li>Fine-tune and improve your model’s predictions by experimenting with hyperparameters, feature engineering, and regularization techniques.</li>
    <li>Visualize your model's predictions and evaluation metrics using graphs (e.g., scatter plots, residual plots) to effectively showcase your results.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 3: Instructions</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Fork the repository.</li>
    <li>Create a folder with your name.</li>
    <li>Add your project files (code, model, visualizations, etc.) and commit the changes.</li>
    <li>Create a pull request once everything is in place.</li>
    <li>After completing the task, provide the link to your GitHub repository.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Step 4: Get to Work & Have Fun!</h2>
<p>This AI/ML challenge is your opportunity to dive deep into a project, explore various techniques, and see how much you can improve your model’s accuracy. Enjoy the learning process and feel free to experiment!</p>
