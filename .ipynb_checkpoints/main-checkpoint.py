# Task:
# Build a Regression Model for Taxi Trip Fare Prediction

# You are provided with training and testing datasets to predict the fare of taxi trips.

# Instructions:

# Train the Model:

# Use the training dataset to train your regression model.
# Ensure you apply appropriate preprocessing techniques (data cleaning, normalization, feature selection, etc.).
# Aim to achieve a 97-100% accuracy in fare prediction.

# Test the Model:

# After training, evaluate the model using the testing dataset.
# Analyze the prediction accuracy and performance of your model, ensuring it reaches the desired accuracy range.
# Objective:
# The goal is to create a highly accurate model that predicts taxi trip fares with 97-100% accuracy based on the available features in the dataset.
